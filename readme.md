# Hello World: The Game
## My first attempted capstone project.

This project uses built-in Java libraries to handle rendering, keyboard and mouse input, sprites, and level generation.

This is an older version of an unfinished, untitled game project I made from the ground up with Java. It was first written back in 2013 when I began learning software engineering as a hobby. The computer I originally wrote this on died, and I was able to salvage this from DropBox.

Missing from this version as of the initial commit include:
* **_COMMENTS_** ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
* Random level generation
* Gamepad input
* Improved modularity

I may come back to this project one day for fun and clean this up a bit. However, if I decide to launch a game in the future, I would rather use a premade framework.
